# App Summary
1. Typical Online Quiz App where you can add your own questions and answers.
2. Each answer can be "checkbox - multiple answers", "radio - single answer" or "text - multiple keyword matching answers".
3. Each quiz card can have multiple questions and each question can have multiple answers depending on chosen "answer type".
4. Responsiveness and theme switch between "light" and "dark" mode thanks to MaterialUI.

#### Why do this?
1. I wanted a quick and easy way to set up quizzes for myself to revise. There are other better quiz websites available but a lot of them come with tons of fluff.
2. I also wanted to get familiar with using CSS libraries like MaterialUI and learn how to handle my array of dataset with nested objects.
